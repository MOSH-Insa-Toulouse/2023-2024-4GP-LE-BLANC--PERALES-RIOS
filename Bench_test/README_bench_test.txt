This folder contains the .xlsx file containing the measurements under tension 
and compression for different types of pencil. Some of the measurements had 
to be redone because they appeared to be random, and also some of them were 
extremely high, thus this Excel file could contain errors or not show the actual 
resistance trend for the different types of pencil.

For measuring the values in this .xlsx file, we used a separate amplifier circuit 
as the one from our PCB seemed to have a malfunction and yielded abnormal values. 
Nonetheless, the circuit should be exactly the same as the one in the PCB.

The bench test used for this part was in the GP Department. It consists of seven 
semi-circles with radii from 2 to 5 cm with an increase of 0,5cm in between each semi-circle.

Each type of pencil is analyzed separately in its own sheet and finally the results 
are plotted in the last sheet.
