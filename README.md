## Necessary components

To carry out this project, we needed : 
  - 1 graphite-based sensor
  - 1 flex sensor
  - 1 digital potentiometer
  - 1 Arduino UNO
  -
  -

## Amplifier circuit 

## Graphite sensor

/// Drawing of the sensor
 Diagram of the sensor used in the project. It will be filled in using different types of pencil. 

## OLED screen
The main page of the OLED screen has 3 different menus: Setting digital potentiometer values, bending sensor values and graphene-based sensor values. The user can select the menu using the rotary encoder. By turning the knob, the user can select the different drop-down menus and by pressing the knob, the user enters a specific menu. 

#### Potentiometer menu :
In this menu, the user selects the resistance value to be given to the potentiometer by placing the cursor over the available values. The user exits the calibration menu by pressing the encoder button. 
#### Flex Sensor menu:
In this menu, the value of the resistance and the value of the angle of the Flex Sensor are displayed.  
#### Flex Sensor menu:
In this menu, the resistance value of the graphite-based sensor is displayed.
