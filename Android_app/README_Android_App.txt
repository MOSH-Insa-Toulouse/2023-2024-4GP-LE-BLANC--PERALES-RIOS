This Android app receives the data from the Arduino and displays it on the screen of the phone. As three types of data are being received (the value from the digital potentiometer, the value from the flex sensor and from the graphite sensor) , a pipe character ("|") is used to separate the three data types from each other.

Another version of the app is also available in this folder. The main improvement from the previous version is that it now has a login screen were the user can register its name and password. The aim of this functionality is that each user can store his/her own data on his/her user. 

This version is still under improvement, and the next version of the app would include an implementation for cloud storage of the data for each user.
